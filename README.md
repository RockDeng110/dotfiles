### reference materials
#### 1. one of best tutorials: https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/onramp-to-vim-surviving-your-first-week

#### 2. reload .vimrc file
        :so %
        :so $MYVIMRC
            :so is short for :source

#### 3. add plugins
          Because ~/.vim is one of the default runtimepath of vim, we can just put plugins/scripts under ~/.vim/plugin
